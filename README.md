# 🧑‍💻 AI Python Tutor App

This repository contains the codebase for an **AI-powered Python tutor application** designed to assist users in learning Python programming. The app features functionalities such as user authentication, interactive content, and a language model (LLM) for answering Python-related queries.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The Python Tutor App uses `Streamlit` for the frontend and includes an AI chatbot powered by LLM (e.g., Llama or Gemini). The app is designed to provide an interactive learning experience by answering Python queries, providing module content, and testing user knowledge.

### Features:
- **User Authentication**: Secure login system to access the app.
- **AI Chatbot**: Uses an LLM model to answer Python-related questions.
- **Content Management**: Interactive Python tutorials and exercises.
- **Database Storage**: SQLite for storing user data, modules, and test scores.
- **Modular Structure**: Clean separation of concerns using multiple scripts for different functionalities.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- OpenAI API (for LLM)
- SQLite
- Required Python packages (see `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bilalahmed6913/Python-Tutor-App.git
   cd Python-Tutor-App
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Create the SQLite databases**:
   - Ensure `database.db` and `testing.db` are present in the root directory.

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Streamlit server**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app2.py
   ```

2. **Open your web browser** and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8501
   ```

### 📜 How to Use

1. **User Authentication**:
   - Register or log in using the credentials to access the app.
   
2. **AI Chatbot**:
   - Ask Python-related questions and get responses powered by the LLM.

3. **Content and Tests**:
   - Access Python tutorials and practice exercises.
   - Test your Python knowledge through quizzes.

### 🛠️ Configuration

Make sure to update the API key for the LLM model in `llm3.py`:
```python
api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## 📚 Documentation

Additional documentation can be found in:
- `modules_all.docx`
- `modules_all.pdf`

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues like **database connection errors** or **model prediction errors**, please ensure:
- The database files (`database.db` and `testing.db`) are properly set up.
- The API key for the LLM model is correctly configured.
- All dependencies are installed from `requirements.txt`.
